# HHA 504 - Assignment # 5

This repository represents the completion of HHA 504 Assignment # 5

Instructions:

Create a new public github repo called 'mysql-selfmanaged'

Create a new VM and install MySQL onto that VM, configure it to allow external connections, and then upload via python a dummy dataset into a dummy database within MySQL. 

Inside the folder, create a readme.md file that contains the following instructions/details: 
- What cloud environment you decided to use
- How you set up your VM (what image you selected - imagine writing a brief tutorial to a new user - what would you include and how to quickly and easily set up a new VM) 
- The commands you used to setup the OS image (how did you update the OS image? how did you install the mysql 
- What changes you needed to make in order to make the mysql instance available to external computers (config file? opening ports?) 
An example dataset that you have found (selected) to insert into the mysql database (provide the sqlalchemy/python code used to upload/insert the data)
